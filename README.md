# Book Management Application

This web application was built to learn .NET Core API, Microsoft SQL Server, and VueJS. It was written using the following technologies:

 * IDE: 
	 * [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
	 * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Database:
  * [Microsoft SQL Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15)
  * [Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://aka.ms/ssmsfullsetup)
 * Server Side: 
	 * [.NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/aspnet/hello-world-tutorial/install)
	 * [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/)
 * Client: 
	 * [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html)
	 * [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)



## Functions

The web app is capable of displaying a table of books held in the database, adding new books, editing existing books, and deleting books from the database. All changes, if saved, will affect the database. When adding or editing a movie, the forms appear in a modal from the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/modal/) frontend toolkit.



## Future Additions

Future itterations of this project may include:

* Search Bar
* Details for a given book upon selection
